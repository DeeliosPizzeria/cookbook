# Buffalo Chicken Dip

  

> Good ass dip

  

## Ingredients

- 2 cans of chicken
- 1 package of cream cheese (8 ounces)
- 1 cup of Moore's Buffalo Sauce
- 1 cup of homemade ranch
- 1 & 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese (1 cup for quick dip, 1 & 1/2 cup for better dip)

  

## Directions

1. Add canned chicken, cream cheese, buffalo, & ranch into a pot.
2. Heat on medium while occasionally mixing, making sure to shred chicken while mixing. I prefer to mix with a pair of tongs and just pinch it.
3. Once the dip is starting to look well mixed (no big chunks of chicken); add 1 cup of cheese and mix into dip.
4. *Can stop here* | I prefer to let the dip simmer on low/medium until you see what looks to be an oil form on the top. The oil makes the dip have a great buffalo taste.
5. Once the oil is present, I like to use the remaining 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese to garnish the top. Once the top has been evenly coated in cheese; place a lid on top and reduce the heat to low. Let this go for maybe 5-10 more minutes, the goal is to just get the cheese to melt on top. This makes the dip have a different texture.
